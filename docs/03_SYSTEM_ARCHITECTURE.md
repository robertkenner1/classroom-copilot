# System Architecture & Design Strategy
## Component Hierarchy and Engineering Handoff Framework

## Executive Summary

**Building Technology That Serves Learning, Not the Other Way Around**

This architecture is grounded in real teacher workflows, specifically the insight from Ed (a middle school teacher friend) that educators are already using AI with simple prompts: "Take the standard and create me a lesson on [topic]." Rather than forcing new behaviors, our system enhances this existing workflow with intelligent personalization and multi-modal content generation.

The architecture preserves teacher agency—AI creates content but teachers control all student-facing decisions. Standards serve as the foundational structure, with student context (mastery levels and learning preferences) providing guardrails for personalized content creation. The system is designed for co-located learning experiences where teachers and students work together, while creating artifacts that extend learning beyond classroom hours.
