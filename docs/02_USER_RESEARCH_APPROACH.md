# User Research Approach
## AI-Based Teacher's Assistant Enhancement

## Executive Summary

**Designing for Student Success Through Teacher Empowerment**

This research framework is grounded in real teacher conversations, starting with insights from Ed, a middle school teacher friend who revealed over a phone call that educators are already using AI tools like ChatGPT with simple workflows: "Take the standard and create me a lesson on [topic]." Rather than reinventing teaching, our research focuses on understanding how to enhance these existing behaviors.

The research methodology prioritizes understanding how teachers currently identify student learning preferences, create multi-modal content, and make real-time adaptations. By building on what teachers already do—while adding intelligent personalization through mastery levels and learning styles—we can create tools that truly serve both teacher efficiency and student learning outcomes.

### Overview
[Document the strategic approach to understanding teacher needs and validating design decisions for the AI-based teacher's assistant]

### Research Objectives
- [ ] Understand how teachers currently identify and adapt to individual student learning preferences
- [ ] Map existing workflows for creating multi-modal content (visual, auditory, kinesthetic, text-based)
- [ ] Identify pain points in differentiating content for diverse learning styles
- [ ] Validate AI-driven content adaptation and personalization approaches
- [ ] Define success metrics for adaptive multi-modal content generation
- [ ] Understand teacher decision-making around content format selection for different students

### Target User Segments
#### Primary: Grade 6-12 Teachers
- [ ] Subject matter specialists (Math, Science, English, etc.)
- [ ] Technology comfort levels (Early adopters vs. Traditional users)
- [ ] Class size variations (15-35 students)
- [ ] School resource levels (Well-funded vs. Under-resourced)

#### Secondary: Elementary Teachers (K-5)
- [ ] Generalist approach to multiple subjects
- [ ] Different pedagogical needs
- [ ] Classroom management focus

### Research Methods & Timeline
#### Phase 1: Discovery (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Stakeholder interviews focusing on learning style identification and content adaptation practices
- [ ] Contextual inquiries during lesson planning sessions with emphasis on differentiation strategies
- [ ] Journey mapping of current multi-modal content creation workflows
- [ ] Observation of how teachers adapt content in real-time based on student responses

#### Phase 2: Validation (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Prototype testing with adaptive multi-modal content generation
- [ ] A/B testing of AI learning style recommendations vs. teacher manual selection
- [ ] Usability testing of content format switching and personalization workflows
- [ ] Validation of AI-generated content quality across different modalities

#### Phase 3: Optimization (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Content effectiveness metrics analysis across different learning styles
- [ ] Teacher feedback integration on AI content format recommendations
- [ ] Student engagement analysis with different content modalities
- [ ] Iterative refinement of learning style detection and content adaptation algorithms

### Key Research Questions

#### Multi-Modal Content Creation & Learning Style Adaptation
- How do teachers currently identify individual student learning preferences (visual, auditory, kinesthetic, reading/writing)?
- What methods do teachers use to create content in different formats for the same concept?
- How do teachers decide which content format to use for which students?
- What are the biggest barriers to creating personalized, multi-modal content?
- How do teachers currently track which content formats work best for each student?

#### Workflow Integration
- How do teachers currently transition between planning and execution when adapting content?
- What triggers the need for mid-lesson content format adjustments?
- How do teachers currently handle differentiation for diverse learning styles?
- What tools or methods do teachers use to manage multiple content versions?

#### AI Interaction Preferences for Content Adaptation
- When would teachers prefer conversational vs. traditional interfaces for content creation?
- How much control do teachers want over AI-generated content format decisions?
- What level of AI reasoning transparency is desired for learning style recommendations?
- How do teachers want to provide feedback on content effectiveness for different students?

#### Success Metrics
#### Multi-Modal Content Effectiveness
- Increased student engagement across different learning styles
- Improved learning outcomes through personalized content delivery
- Reduced time spent on manual content format creation
- Higher teacher satisfaction with differentiation capabilities

#### Workflow Integration
- Time savings in creating multiple content versions for diverse learners
- Improvement in lesson personalization and student engagement
- Reduction in administrative overhead for content management
- Teacher confidence in serving diverse learning preferences

### Research Methodology
#### Qualitative Methods
- [ ] Semi-structured interviews (60-90 minutes)
- [ ] Contextual observations in classrooms
- [ ] Think-aloud protocols during tool usage
- [ ] Focus groups for feature prioritization

#### Quantitative Methods
- [ ] Usage analytics from existing product
- [ ] Time-on-task measurements
- [ ] Feature adoption rates
- [ ] Teacher satisfaction surveys (NPS, CSAT)

### Ethical Considerations
- [ ] Student privacy protection in classroom observations
- [ ] Teacher consent for workflow documentation
- [ ] Data anonymization protocols
- [ ] Institutional review board compliance

### Expected Outcomes
- [ ] Teacher persona refinement with learning style adaptation expertise and challenges
- [ ] Student learning preference identification and content format effectiveness patterns
- [ ] Prioritized feature roadmap for adaptive multi-modal content generation
- [ ] Design principles for AI-driven personalized content creation
- [ ] Validation framework for content effectiveness across different learning styles
- [ ] Guidelines for AI transparency in learning style recommendations
