# Presentation Outline
## 45-Minute Design Challenge Presentation

## Executive Summary

**Technology in Service of Human Connection**

This presentation demonstrates how thoughtful AI design can amplify the most important aspect of education: the relationship between teacher and student. Rather than replacing human judgment with artificial intelligence, our approach uses AI to eliminate administrative friction, enabling teachers to spend more time on what they do bestâ€”inspiring, supporting, and connecting with students.

Every feature, component, and system decision is evaluated through the lens of student impact. Does this help teachers understand their students better? Does it free up time for meaningful interaction? Does it preserve the creativity and empathy that make great teaching possible? The answer to these questions drives our design philosophy and technical implementation.
