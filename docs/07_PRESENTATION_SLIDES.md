# **PROBLEM APPROACH** *(5 minutes)*

---

## **Slide 3: The Challenge Reframe**
### **How do we create an AI assistant that amplifies teacher expertise rather than replacing it?**

**Current Reality**
- Teachers spend 60% of time on administrative tasks
- Only 40% on actual teaching and student interaction

**The Opportunity**
- AI handles routine tasks
- Teachers focus on high-impact student connection
- Preserve the human elements that make teaching transformative

---

## **Slide 4: Design Philosophy**
### **Technology in Service of Learning**

**Grounded in Real Teacher Conversations**

*15-minute phone call with Ed, a middle school teacher friend*

**Key Insight**: Teachers already use ChatGPT with:
*"Take the standard and create me a lesson on [topic]"*

**Our Approach**: Build on existing behavior, don't replace it

---

## **Slide 5: Core Principles**
### **Five Pillars of Our Design**

1. **Standards-Driven Foundation** → Curriculum standards as structural base
2. **Teacher Agency Preserved** → AI suggests, teachers decide
3. **Existing Workflow Enhancement** → Build on what teachers already do
4. **Contextual Personalization** → Simple data drives powerful adaptation
5. **Co-located Learning Focus** → Teacher-student collaboration + extended artifacts

---

## **Slide 6: Scope Definition**
### **Focused but Scalable**

**Target**: Grade 8 Mathematics *(expandable framework)*

**Core Workflows**:
