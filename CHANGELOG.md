### üöÄ Major New Lesson Generation Flow

#### ‚ú® Enhanced User Experience
- **5-Second Lesson Generation**: Completely rebuilt lesson generation flow for optimal speed and engagement
- **Streaming AI Reasoning**: Real-time AI thought process visible during content generation
- **Skeleton Loading**: Professional stencil animations while content loads
- **Seamless Transitions**: Smooth progression from reasoning to content reveal

#### üéØ New Lesson Generation Sequence
1. **Instant Start**: User prompt appears immediately when lesson generation begins
2. **AI Reasoning Stream**: Fast 2-second reasoning display while stencils show
3. **Content Reveal**: Lesson content appears after reasoning completes
4. **Confirmation Summary**: AI provides brief confirmation of lesson creation
5. **Total Time**: Complete flow in exactly 5 seconds

#### üîß Technical Improvements
- **Single AI Turn Only**: Fixed duplicate AI messages during generation
- **Proper State Management**: Clean `isInitialGenerating` flag prevents interference
- **Unique Message IDs**: Eliminated React duplicate key warnings
- **Modal-Level AI Chat**: Repositioned AI assistant for better layout stability
- **Grid Layout**: Switched to CSS Grid for consistent column widths

### üé® UI/UX Enhancements

#### Modal Improvements
- **Unified Header**: Moved lesson title, draft/live toggle, and minimize button to modal header
- **Natural Title Width**: Dynamic title input sizing based on content length
- **Transparent Minimize Button**: Clean, modern button styling with proper spacing
- **Consistent Switch Logic**: Unified toggle behavior between lesson cards and modal

#### Layout & Spacing
- **Increased Padding**: More spacious lesson content with 12px horizontal/vertical padding
- **Section Spacing**: Enhanced spacing between lesson sections (12px gaps)
- **Tab Spacing**: Added breathing room under lesson tabs
- **Muted Borders**: Softened select component borders for cleaner appearance

#### Interactive Elements
- **Improved Scrollbars**: Stable scrollbar behavior without layout shifts
- **Undo Button Positioning**: Proper placement after second AI turn
- **Removed Borders**: Cleaner interface by removing unnecessary action row borders

### üêõ Bug Fixes

#### AI Chat Flow
- **Fixed Multiple AI Turns**: Prevented duplicate messages during lesson generation
- **Eliminated Loading Overlap**: Removed conflicting loading states in modal
- **React Key Conflicts**: Resolved duplicate key errors in chat history
- **Auto-Generation Prevention**: Disabled UnifiedPromptComponent interference during initial generation

#### State Management
- **AI Suggestion Flow**: Fixed duplicate lessons when opening AI suggestions without changes
- **Lesson Modification Tracking**: Only move AI suggestions to "My Lessons" when actually modified
- **Runtime Errors**: Fixed React component export and import conflicts

#### Layout Stability
- **Fixed Column Width**: Consistent lesson column width regardless of AI chat state
- **Modal Border**: Removed unnecessary borders and shadows around modal
- **Content Loading**: Proper skeleton-to-content transitions

### üéõÔ∏è Component Architecture

#### New Components & Features
- **Skeleton Loading System**: Professional stencil animations for all lesson sections
- **Streaming AI Messages**: Real-time reasoning and summary display
- **Modal-Level AI Assistant**: Repositioned for better layout control
- **Unified Toggle Logic**: Shared state management between lesson cards and modal

#### Code Quality
- **Unique ID Generation**: All messages use timestamp + random string pattern
- **Clean State Flags**: `isInitialGenerating` and `contentVisible` for precise control
- **Simplified Generation Logic**: Removed complex async chains for better reliability
- **Component Separation**: Clear separation between modal and component responsibilities

### üìä Performance Improvements
- **Faster Generation**: 5-second total lesson creation time
- **Reduced Re-renders**: Optimized state updates and component rendering
- **Stable Layout**: Grid-based layout prevents content shifting
- **Smooth Animations**: Professional transitions between states
