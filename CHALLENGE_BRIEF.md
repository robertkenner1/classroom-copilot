# Head of Design Take-Home Assignment

## Challenge Brief

**Design an AI-based teacher's assistant** that can handle anything a teacher might need during school and non-school hours. You can choose any age range of teaching you'd like.

This is a design exercise - no competitive research is necessary as this doesn't relate to our domain.

## Time & Scope

- **Timeline**: One week to complete
- **Questions welcome**: Feel free to reach out with clarifying questions about users, product context, or requirements.

## Your Deliverables

### 1. System Architecture

Show your systems thinking around component hierarchy, interaction patterns, and design system structure. Focus on how you'd organize components and patterns so engineers can build new teacher workflows without design involvement for established paradigms. 

To be clear - you do not need to provide a full architecture, but you do need to define how you'd approach building/buying one.

### 2. User Research Approach

Considering this is an existing product with existing users, how would you approach user research for this enhancement? What would be most important to understand about teachers' needs and current workflows?

### 3. Wireframes

Show us what this product looks like. You can keep it to wireframes, but be sure to include a few high fidelity components in there. 

### 4. User Journey Example

End-to-end flow showing your components and system in action. Pick a core teacher workflow and demonstrate how the conversational and non-conversational interfaces work together.

## Constraints

- Must include **both conversational and non-conversational interfaces**
- **Desktop-focused tool**
- Include **Information Architecture** considerations
- **Do not use Valence's existing design language** (create your own approach)

## Fidelity Expectations

You don't need to make this entire brief high-fidelity. The majority can be wireframes with 2-3 key components executed in high-fidelity to demonstrate visual craft and attention to detail.

## Evaluation Criteria

**Systems Thinking (Primary Focus)**: Component architecture, reusability approach, and design system strategy that enables team velocity

**AI-Specific Design**: Thoughtful handling of uncertainty, loading states, error scenarios, and conversational UI patterns

**Technical Feasibility**: Realistic approach to implementation and handoff documentation

**User Experience**: Clear, intuitive interactions across different complexity levels

**Strategic Thinking**: User research approach and problem-solving methodology

**Visual Craft**: Polish and attention to detail in selected high-fidelity components

## Presentation Format

- **Duration**: 45-minute conversation
- **Audience**: CPO, Principal Engineer, AI Engineer, Designer
- **Format**: Present your work with questions welcomed throughout
- **Suggested flow**: Problem approach (5min) → System architecture (15min) → Key workflows & components (15min) → Open discussion (10min)

## Questions?

Don't hesitate to reach out to Noam directly (noam@valence.co) during the week if you need clarification on user context, technical constraints, or any aspect of the challenge.

We're excited to see your approach to this complex design challenge!
